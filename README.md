# echo
assembly program similar to the Unix/Linux command line program echo

# Build & run 
- the make file uses the as and ld commands to build the program
- on Unix/Linux X86_64 systems you can build the program by running the command:
```sh
make
```

## 100% assembly 
All of these programs are intentionally made with plain CPU instructions.
it does not use the C standard library or libraries from any other language.

### Who is this for?
for most programming languages today, there are plenty of small programs and open code bases that everyone can use to learn. But not for assembly language. As if the language wasn't challenging enough there are hardly any complete, non-trivial, programs to be found in websites or books. and many of those rely on higher-level languages for anything that's not dead simple.

These programs are for people interested in assembly and want to see working examples assembly programs.
